# In silico labeling: Predicting fluorescent labels in unlabeled images

This is the code for
<a href="http://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(18)30364-7">In silico labeling: Predicting fluorescent labels in
unlabeled images</a>. It is the result of a collaboration between [Google Accelerated
Science](https://research.google.com/teams/gas/) and two external labs: the [Lee
Rubin lab](https://hscrb.harvard.edu/res-fl-rubin) at Harvard and the [Steven
Finkbeiner lab](https://gladstone.org/our-science/people/steve-finkbeiner) at
Gladstone. See also [our blog post](https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/04/seeing-more-with-in-silico-labeling-of.html) and our [full dataset, including many predictions we couldn't fit in the paper](data.md).

This code in this repository can be used to run training and inference of our
model on a single machine, and can be adapted for distributed training. It also contains a set of weights created by training
the model on the data in Conditions A, B, C, and D from the paper.

This README will explain how to:

1.  Restore the model from the provided checkpoint and run inference on an image
    from our test set.
1.  Train the pre-trained model on a new dataset (Condition E).

Please note, the example in this README deviates from the way transfer learning is demonstrated in the paper.
In the paper, the model is trained once on all datasets, including Condition E; this is also called multi-task learning.
In this guide, we're starting with a pre-trained model on Conditions A, B, C, and D, and incrementally training it on Condition E.
The benefit of the latter technique is it requires less time to learn a new task, but it is likely to overfit if overtrained (see below).

The model here differs from the model described in the paper in one significant
way: this model does an initial linear projection to 16 features per pixel,
where the model in the paper does not have this step. This allows the model to
take as input *z*-stacks with varying numbers of *z* depths; the only thing that
needs to be relearned is the initial linear projection. Here, we'll use it to
take full advantage of the 26 *z* depths in Condition E (the other conditions
have 13 *z* depths).

You can also find the complete set of preprocessed data used for the paper,
along with predictions, [here](data.md).

## Installation

### Code

The code requires Python 3 and depends on NumPy, TensorFlow, and OpenCV. You can
install TensorFlow using [this guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/),
which will also install NumPy. If you follow that guide you will have installed
`pip3` and you'll be able to install OpenCV with the command: `pip3 install
--upgrade opencv-python`.

We're using [Bazel](https://www.bazel.build/) to build the code and run tests.
Though not strictly necessary, we suggest you install it (the rest of this
README will assume you have it).

This code has been tested in Debian 10 with TensorFlow 1.9 on a machine with 64 GB RAM.
It is not optimized for memory use, and has been reported to fail with a Python `MemoryError` on a machine with 16 GB RAM.
Based on tests with `ulimit`, we recommend using a machine with at least 32 GB RAM.

### Data

We'll work with the data sample in [`data_sample.zip`](https://storage.googleapis.com/in-silico-labeling/data_sample.zip)
(Warning: 2 GB download) and a checkpoint from the pre-trained model
in [`checkpoints.zip`](https://storage.googleapis.com/in-silico-labeling/checkpoints.zip). If
you have [`gsutil`](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil) installed, you can also use the commands:

    gsutil -m cp gs://in-silico-labeling/checkpoints.zip .
    gsutil -m cp gs://in-silico-labeling/data_sample.zip .

The rest of this README will assume you've downloaded and extracted these
archives to `checkpoints/` and `data_sample/`.

## Running the pre-trained model.

Training and inference are controlled by the script `isl/launch.py`. We recommend
you invoke the script with Bazel (see below), because it will handle dependency
management for you.

The `checkpoints.zip` file contains parameters from a model trained on
Conditions A, B, C, and D. To run the model on a sample from Condition B, run
this command from the project root:

    export BASE_DIRECTORY=/tmp/isl
    bazel run isl:launch -- \
      --alsologtostderr \
      --base_directory $BASE_DIRECTORY \
      --mode EVAL_EVAL \
      --metric INFER_FULL \
      --stitch_crop_size 1500 \
      --restore_directory $(pwd)/checkpoints \
      --read_pngs \
      --dataset_eval_directory $(pwd)/data_sample/condition_b_sample \
      --infer_channel_whitelist DAPI_CONFOCAL,MAP2_CONFOCAL,NFH_CONFOCAL

If you get a syntax error, make sure you're using Python 3, not Python 2.

In the above:

1.  `BASE_DIRECTORY` is the working directory for the model. It will be created
    if it doesn't already exist, and it's where the model predictions will be
    written. You can set it to whatever you want.
1.  `alsologtostderr` will cause progress information to be printed to the
    terminal.
1.  `stitch_crop_size` is the size of the crop for which we'll perform
    inference. If set to 1500 it may take an hour on a single machine, so try
    smaller numbers first.
1.  `infer_channel_whitelist` is the list of fluorescence channels we wish to
    infer. For the Condition B data, this should be a subset of `DAPI_CONFOCAL`,
    `MAP2_CONFOCAL`, and `NFH_CONFOCAL`.

If you run this command, you should get a `target_error_panel.png` that looks
like this:

<p align="center">
<img width="600" alt="Initial predictions for Condition B" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/in-silico-labeling/doc/initial_predictions/condition_b/00984658/target_error_panel.jpg">
</p>

Each row is one of the whitelisted channels you provided; in this case it's one
row for each of the `DAPI_CONFOCAL`, `MAP2_CONFOCAL`, and `NFH_CONFOCAL` channels. The boxes with the
purple borders show the predicted images (in this case the medians of the
per-pixel distributions). The boxes with the teal borders show the true
fluorescence images. The boxes with the black borders show errors, with false
positives in orange and false negatives in blue.

The script will also generate a file called [`input_error_panel.png`](https://storage.googleapis.com/in-silico-labeling/doc/initial_predictions/condition_b/00984658/input_error_panel.jpg), which shows
the 26 transmitted light input images along with auto-encoding predictions and
errors. For this condition, there were only 13 *z*-depths, so this visualization
will show each *z*-depth twice.

## Training the pre-trained model on a new dataset.

Condition E contains a cell type not previously seen by the model (human cancer
cells), imaged with a transmitted light modality not previously seen (DIC), and
labeled with a marker not previously seen (CellMask).
We have two wells in our sample data (B2 and B3), so let's use B2 for training and B3 for evaluation.

To see how well the model can predict labels on the evaluation dataset *before* training, run:

    export BASE_DIRECTORY=/tmp/isl
    bazel run isl:launch -- \
      --alsologtostderr \
      --base_directory $BASE_DIRECTORY \
      --mode EVAL_EVAL \
      --metric INFER_FULL \
      --stitch_crop_size 1500 \
      --restore_directory $(pwd)/checkpoints \
      --read_pngs \
      --dataset_eval_directory $(pwd)/data_sample/condition_e_sample_B3 \
      --infer_channel_whitelist DAPI_CONFOCAL,CELLMASK_CONFOCAL \
      --noinfer_simplify_error_panels

This should produce this target error panel:

<p align="center">
<img width="800" alt="Initial predictions for Condition E" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/in-silico-labeling/doc/initial_predictions/condition_e/00000000/target_error_panel.jpg">
</p>


This is like the error panels above, but the first row is `DAPI_CONFOCAL` and the second is `CELLMASK_CONFOCAL`.
And because we used `noinfer_simplify_error_panels` it includes more statistics of the
pixel distribution. Previously, there was one purple-bordered box which showed the
medians of the pixel distributions. Now there are four purple-bordered boxes which show,
in order, the mode, median, mean, and standard deviation. There are now three
boxes with black borders, showing the same error visualization as before, but
for the mode and mean as well as the median. The white-bordered boxes are a new
kind of error visualization, in which colors on the grayline between black and
white correspond to correct predictions, orange corresponds to a false positive,
and blue corresponds to a false negative. The final mango-bordered box is not
informative for this exercise.

The pre-trained model hasn't seen the Condition E dataset, so we should expect
its predictions to be poor. Note, however, there is some transfer of the nuclear
label even before training.

You can find the input images, consisting of a *z*-stack of 26 images,
[here](https://storage.cloud.google.com/in-silico-labeling/doc/initial_predictions/condition_e/00000000/input_error_panel.jpg) (Warning: 100 MB download).

### Training

We can train the network on the Condition E data on a single machine using a
command like:

    export BASE_DIRECTORY=/tmp/isl
    bazel run isl:launch -- \
      --alsologtostderr \
      --base_directory $BASE_DIRECTORY \
      --mode TRAIN \
      --metric LOSS \
      --master "" \
      --restore_directory $(pwd)/checkpoints \
      --read_pngs \
      --dataset_train_directory $(pwd)/data_sample/condition_e_sample_B2

By default, this uses the ADAM optimizer with a learning rate of 1e-4. If you
wish to visualize training progress, you can run
[TensorBoard](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard) on `BASE_DIRECTORY`:

    tensorboard --logdir $BASE_DIRECTORY

You should eventually see a training curve that looks like this:

<p align="center">
<img width="400" alt="Train curve" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/in-silico-labeling/doc/train/train_curve.png">
</p>

After 50,000 steps, which takes about a week on a 32-core machine, predictions
on the eval data should have substantially improved.
You can run this command to generate predictions:

    export BASE_DIRECTORY=/tmp/isl
    bazel run isl:launch -- \
      --alsologtostderr \
      --base_directory $BASE_DIRECTORY \
      --mode EVAL_EVAL \
      --metric INFER_FULL \
      --stitch_crop_size 1500 \
      --read_pngs \
      --dataset_eval_directory $(pwd)/data_sample/condition_e_sample_B3 \
      --infer_channel_whitelist DAPI_CONFOCAL,CELLMASK_CONFOCAL \
      --noinfer_simplify_error_panels

Note, we've dropped the `restore_directory` argument, so the model will run inference using the latest checkpoint it finds in `BASE_DIRECTORY`.

Here's what the predictions should look like on the evaluation data:

<p align="center">
<img width="800" alt="Predictions for the Condition E evaluation well (B3) after 50K steps" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/in-silico-labeling/doc/train/B3/00050078/target_error_panel.jpg">
</p>

Note, there is a bug in the normalization of the `DAPI_CONFOCAL` channel causing
it to have a reduced dynamic range in the ground-truth image. Comparing the
initial nuclear predictions with these, it is clear the network learned to match
the reduced dynamic range.

For reference, here's what predictions should look like on the train data:

<p align="center">
<img width="800" alt="Predictions for Condition A" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/in-silico-labeling/doc/train/B2/00050659/target_error_panel.jpg">
</p>

Note, if we train too long the model will eventually overfit on the train data
and predictions will worsen. This was not an issue in the paper, because there
we simultaneously trained on all tasks, so that each task regularized the
others.

## TODOs

1.  Fix the tests.
1.  Fix the `DAPI_CONFOCAL` normalization bug for the Condition E data. Note: This bug was introduced after
    data was generated for the paper.
